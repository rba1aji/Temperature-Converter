# Temperature-Converter
My first website with HTML, CSS and Java Script 
<br/>
<h3>Purpose:</h3> can be used to convert or change the unit of temperature. 
<br/>
<br/>
We can convert the temperature from Celcius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celcius, Kelvin to Celcius, Kelvin to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Kelvin and Celcius to Kelvin with in few seconds. 
    I hope it will be useful application. Most probably, the physics students and teachers will be benefited.
